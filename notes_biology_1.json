Morgan** in *Drosophila*.\n\n### 🔄 Crossing Over\n- Exchange of genetic material between **non-sister chromatids** of homologous chromosomes during **Prophase I of Meiosis**.\n- Creates **new combinations** of genes (recombination).\n\n### ⚕️ Sex-Linked Inheritance\n- Traits controlled by genes on **sex chromosomes**.\n- Examples:\n  - **Colour blindness** (X-linked recessive)\n  - **Haemophilia** (X-linked recessive)\n\n### 🧬 Mutation\n- Sudden change in **DNA sequence or gene**.\n- **Gene mutation:** Affects single gene (e.g., Sickle cell anaemia)\n- **Chromosomal mutation:** Affects chromosome structure or number.\n\n### 💉 Sickle Cell Anaemia\n- Caused by **point mutation** in gene coding for β-chain of haemoglobin.\n- Substitution: Glutamic acid → Valine.\n- Genotypes:\n  - **Hbᴬ Hbᴬ** – Normal\n  - **Hbᴬ Hbˢ** – Carrier\n  - **Hbˢ Hbˢ** – Diseased\n\n### 📉 Pedigree Analysis\n- Study of inheritance across generations.\n- Helps identify:\n  - Dominant/recessive traits\n  - Sex-linked diseases\n  - Genetic counselling\n\n### 🧾 Chromosomal Disorders\n| Disorder | Chromosome | Cause | Characteristics |\n|-----------|-------------|--------|----------------|\n| Down’s Syndrome | 21 (Trisomy) | Extra chromosome 21 | Mental retardation, short height, flat face |\n| Turner’s Syndrome | X0 | Missing one X in females | Sterile female, short stature |\n| Klinefelter’s Syndrome | XXY | Extra X in males | Sterile male, feminine traits |\n\n### 🔚 Summary\n- Mendel → Father of Genetics.\n- Three Laws: Dominance, Segregation, Independent Assortment.\n- Variation arises due to **crossing over, mutation, recombination**.\n- Chromosomal and gene disorders cause **inherited diseases**."
